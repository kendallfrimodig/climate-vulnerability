Cross-Examination of Climate Vulnerability Index
================

### Objective

Climate change is expected to exacerbate medical emergencies which could
be triggered due to direct factors such as more frequent extreme
temperatures, or broader events such as winter storms or wildfires which
can compromise power grids and leave communities without the means for
heat or air conditioning

In light of these projections, which we have already began to see play
out (recent winter storm in Texas, Wildfires in California) health
departments at all levels of government have invested in developing
mitigation strategies for climate vulnerable communities. For this work
to be feasible, it is important to narrow down which regions are in most
need of investment.

The Climate Vulnerability Index developed by Tony Fristachi was intended
to rank communities of New Mexico based on the aggregation of numerous
factors lending to risk, such as socioeconomic or age characteristics.

The following program aims to cross examine the 22 small areas
identified as being most vulnerable, within the context of the
individual measures that make up the aggregate rank. A common practice
in the development of indices is ranking based on relevance - however
this weighting can often be arbitrary. Furthermore the quality of each
data point must be considered, as some measures are discretely collected
from every resident of the state, whereas others may be projected based
on survey samples.

As 22 small areas were identified as having a 5/5 vulnerability rank,
there remains a need for narrowing down the scope of future work.
Through the basic distributions one can see where each of these small
areas stands in terms of relevant measures.

### Packages used

Beeswarm is a package which produces a variation on a simple dot plot.
the algorithm used allows for a more continuous representation while
visualizing the overall distribution for a single measure well.

In order for the point-wise color and legend entries to function, a
proxy ‘list’ must be used - which must mirror the sort order of the
data-set plotted. This list must have a identical variable (values and
name) as the source data.

The string of hexadecimal colors for each of the 22 small areas must
also be sorted respectively.

### Visualizations

The first set of figures displays the 22 small areas individually within
distributions for each individual measure for the index.

The second set produces a collection of similar figures, but for each
small area individually. This is accomplished by integrating a loop
within the custom plot function, where the highlighting color is
inserted sequentially within the list of color strings.

### Importing from csv

``` r
datadir <- "./data"

    load(file.path(datadir,"exposure-dohsa.Rdata"))
    load(file.path(datadir,"healthcare-dohsa.Rdata"))
    load(file.path(datadir,"household-dohsa.Rdata"))
    load(file.path(datadir,"housing-dohsa.Rdata"))
    load(file.path(datadir,"minlang-dohsa.Rdata"))
    load(file.path(datadir,"overall-dohsa.Rdata"))
    load(file.path(datadir,"socio-dohsa.Rdata"))
```

### Working data sets

``` r
tmp <- overall_dohsa  %>% select(dohsa,overall_dohsa_rankings) %>%
      mutate(rank = ifelse(overall_dohsa_rankings==5,2,1))
    
    prepare <- function(i,...) {
      
        i %>% left_join(tmp, by="dohsa")  %>%
            mutate(sa = as.numeric(ifelse(rank==1,999,dohsa))) %>%
            arrange(sa) %>%  rownames_to_column(var="id") %>%
            mutate(id = as.numeric(id))  %>% ...
    }
    

  overall <-  prepare(overall_dohsa, select_all())
    
   exp <- prepare(exposure_dohsa, select_all())
   
    health <- prepare(healthcare_dohsa, select_all())
    
    household <- data.frame(prepare(household_dohsa, select_all()))
    
    housing <- prepare(housing_dohsa, select_all())
    
    racelang <- prepare(minlang_dohsa, select_all())
    
    socio <- prepare(socio_dohsa, select_all())

    temp  <- tmp %>% mutate(sa = as.numeric(ifelse(rank==1,999,dohsa))) %>%
      select(sa) %>% arrange(sa) %>%  rownames_to_column(var="id") %>%
      mutate(id = as.numeric(id)) %>% mutate(lis= ifelse(id>22,23,id))
    
    sa <- temp$lis
```
