# climate_vulnerability_viz
cross examination of pre-identified climate vulnerable communities, within the context of individual socioeconomic and health indicator measures. 
Aimed to cross validate slightly modified version of the CDC Social Vulnerability Index, specific to New Mexico, and aggregated for small groups of 
census tracts called small areas, which provide more balanced population comparisons and were delegated on an informed basis within the Department of health.

Where the top 25 highest ranked small areas lie, with respect to the individual distributions for each measure, gives insight into how the ranking is balanced
across measures but also identifies individual features or themes specific to regions of New Mexico, ultimately conveying that risk to climate related events differs
from community to community.
